**O(1) - Excellent/Best**
When your calculation is not dependent on the input size, it is a constant time complexity (O(1)).

**O(log n) - Good**
When the input size is reduced by half, maybe when iterating, handling recursion, or whatsoever, it is a logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)).

**O(n) - Fair**
When you have a single loop within your algorithm, it is linear time complexity (O(n)).

O(n log n) - Bad

**O(n^2), O(2^n) and O(n!) - Horrible/Worst**

When you have nested loops within your algorithm, meaning a loop in a loop, it is quadratic time complexity (O(n^2)). 
When the growth rate doubles with each addition to the input, it is exponential time complexity (O2^n).
